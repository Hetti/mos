enter the VM with:
$ vagrant ssh

the following commands have to be executed inside the VM!

1) after provisioning the VM you have to set the 'admin' superuser password manually
$ ./manage.py changepassword admin

2) start the server bound on all interfaces instead of 127.0.0.1 only
$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
